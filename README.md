# Cab-Fare-Prediction
You are a cab rental start-up company. You have successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch your cab service across the country. You have collected the historical data from your pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. You need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city.
# Data
Our task is to Build a suitable model that will best fit for analyzing fare prediction for test data provided.
 There are 07 variables in our data in which 6 are independent variables and 1 (Fare_amount) is dependent variable. Since our target variable is continuous in nature, this is a regression problem. 
Variables Information: 
1. fare_amount 
2. pickup_datetime
3. pickup_longitude 
4. pickup_latitude 
5. dropoff_longitude 
6. dropoff_latitude 
7. passenger_count 
•	pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the cab ride started.
•	pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride started.
•	pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride started.
•	dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride ended.
•	dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride ended.
•	passenger_count - an integer indicating the number of passengers in the cab ride.
